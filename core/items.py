"""Item ledger: the individual issues of the exact checks, tracked across runs, so a blog's report can say how many
were fixed, how many are new and how many are still open (SK, 2026-10-27).

An item is one thing to fix: one link (link check), one missing language of one post, one unsupported language;
from discovery (blog subdomains, 2026-10-30), one URL a sitemap lists wrongly (twice, in two sitemaps, without
hreflang, ...) or one sitemap with a file-level problem (no lastmod, cannot be fetched, ...).
Only exhaustive checks have items; sampled checks (crawl audit, text check, speed) stay at finding level, because a
page leaving the sample is not a fix. An item that is gone counts as fixed when its place still exists, and as
removed when it is gone (a deleted post is not a fix): link check, the file in the blog's repo; discovery, the URL
in the run's sitemaps (sitemap-level items always count as fixed: dropping a broken sitemap is a fix). Each run
closes only items of its own source.

Ledger (reports/<tenant>/items.json): {"runs": [run refs], "baseline": {host: {"run", "date"}},
"items": {key: {"source", "check", "host", "page", "file", "link", "first_seen", "last_seen", "fixed", "removed"}}}
(items without "source" are link-check items).
Shown as issues = fixed + open, fixed, open and the latest scan date (SK, 2026-10-27: no "new", no baseline on
the pages; new issues show as a growing issue count). Fixed % = fixed / issues; removed items count neither way.
